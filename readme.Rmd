The main purpose of this script is to automate the mundane task of creating a tidy_data set 

 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set 

 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

 Appropriate column names were assigned to each dataset.

 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 

 Appropriately labels the data set with its descriptive name 

 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each    subject.
